# Overview
This folder contains Excel templates that can be used to populate files with the same names contained in `{root}/raw`. The templates will work properly for users who have the appropriate Bloomberg access and the Bloomberg Excel Plug-in properly installed.

# Setup
Open the template in Excel on a computer with access to Bloomberg. Update each spreadsheet of the Excel workbook. After the values have populated, copy each spreadsheet and paste the values (this removes the Bloomberg formulas so as to avoid "#NAME?"). 
Save each template into the raw folder.
